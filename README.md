This is my custom nvim setup based on the repo and youtube series from https://github.com/LunarVim/Neovim-from-scratch

gruvbox is the choice of theme for now.

Instructions:

1. You should be able to just drop these files into ./config/nvim and install neovim.
2. Open up any file and let all your plugins and linters download.
  a. You might have to open and close neovim several times to get all the downloads to finish the first time.
